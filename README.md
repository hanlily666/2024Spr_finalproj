## Area 51 Variation

This program aims to design and implement a variation on the 51 area puzzle. The inspiration is from
https://krazydad.com/area51/ and Mr. John Weible.

## Design:

I would get rid of the uncircled numbers but add the Air Force
protection around fences. Air Force security humans always patrol along the (inside) the fence line. (meaning the
fence must be adjacent to every human on at least one side)
Cactus, 'C': it can only be outside the fences
Alien, 'A': it can only be inside the fences
Circled number: since in this variation there is no uncircled clue, all numbers mean the circled clue
                  It means are always inside the fence; they indicate visibility conditions.
                  This number counts the total squares visible looking north, south, east, and west from the coded location,
                  and includes the code square itself.
